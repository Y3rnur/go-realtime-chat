# Go Realtime Chat

A small, opinionated skeleton for a realtime web chat application with a Go backend and a lightweight frontend. This repository contains an initial frontend layout (HTML/CSS/JS) and space to add a Go-based WebSocket server and persistence later.

**Crucial note — In progress:**  
This project is under active development and currently only provides a starting skeleton. It is not an MVP or production-ready reference. Expect missing features, changing APIs, and incomplete server code. If you clone the repo, treat it as work-in-progress learning material rather than a finished product.

I will try to add features slowly and update this README.md, so anyone can know which features are included and not included.

Currently, I just started the frontend. I will add the server logic, database, and others after some days.
